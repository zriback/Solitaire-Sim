# Solitaire-Sim

This repository is dedicated to the development of a python program designed to simulation thousands if not millions of solitaire games as quickly as possible.

The idea is to hopefully be able to learn about the game by simply making the computer play the game a lot using different strategies and keeping track of different statistics.

Some questions I hope to answer with this project are:
	What percent of solitaire games are winnable using a given strategy?
	What is the best strategy to use to win the most games?
	What percent of starting deck combinations are actually winnable?
		Is it possible for a given starting configuration to be literally unwinnable regardless of strategy?

# Lesser Known Terminology
Here is some of the lesser known solitaire terminology that is used in this project
	Tableau - the area where the game is played with seven piles of cards
	Stock - the deck from which new cards are introduced into the tableau by the player
	Foundation - the area where cards are collected by suit. The game is won when all cards are in their proper place in the foundation
